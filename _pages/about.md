My name is Brian Maloney and I am Theoretical Physics PhD student at UCD. I am working under [Dr. Ciaran Hickey](https://ciaranhickey.weebly.com/) on Non-Linear Magnetic Response.

This website is very much a work in progress and I am hoping to keep it updated with cool things I am working on. Feel free to look around but there is unfortunately not a lot to see.
